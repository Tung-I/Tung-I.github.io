Tung-I Chen is a Research Assistant at Communications and Multimedia Lab, [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). He was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/) and received his M.S. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE) in 2021. Before that, he received his B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering (BME) at [National Cheng Kung University](https://www.ncku.edu.tw/) in 2019. His research lies in developing generalizable machine learning models/algorithms that can tackle uncertainty under dynamic environments. Currently, he is also highly interested in large-scale optimization and sequential decision-making problems.
