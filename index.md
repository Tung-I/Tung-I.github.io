I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst, advised by Professor [Ramesh K. Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/) and Professor [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). Before joining UMass, I received a M.S. degree in Computer Science from National Taiwan University (NTU), where I worked with Professor [Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). 

My research sits at the intersection of video streaming and machine learning, focusing on practical volumetric video streaming systems. In particular, I develop neural-enhanced content-distribution frameworks that capture, compress, deliver, and render 3D visual media. This entails minimizing both the size of the 3D representations and the ML inference latency, all while preserving high visual quality. Currently, I am exploring on-the-fly edge transcoding for 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging standard video codecs to compress feature planes.

Prior to my Ph.D. work, I focused on few-shot learning in computer vision, with applications that enhance the generalizability and adaptability of object detectors.
