I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst, where I am working with Professor [Ramesh K. Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/) and Professor [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). Previously, I received a Master degree in Computer Science from National Taiwan University (NTU) where I worked with Professor [Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). 

I am working at the intersection of video streaming and machine learning. My research focuses on using deep learning techniques to enable 3D volumetric video streaming under low-bandwidth and low-latency costraints. The project I am currently working on aims to explore immersive video conferencing systems where virtual and physical participants meet, sit in their seats, face each other and have natural social interactions. Such a system requires a novel semantic-aware content distribution framework that can capture, compress, deliver, and render selected visual media (e.g., 360 videos, 3D graphics) with low latency. The challenge will be how to minimize bandwidth consumption and the latency of ML inference while preserving a satisfactory level of visual quality.

Before starting my Ph.D., I've worked on applying few-shot learning to computer vision tasks, such as improving the generalizability and adaptability of an object detector.
