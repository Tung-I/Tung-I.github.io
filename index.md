I am a research assistant at the Communications and Multimedia Lab, [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). In my master's study, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering (BME) at [National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)](https://www.ncku.edu.tw/). My research interest lies in developing generalizable models or algorithms that can tackle uncertainty under dynamic environments. I am highly interested in online optimization and sequential decision-making problems.
