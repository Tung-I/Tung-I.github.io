I am a first-year PhD student in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I am advised by [Ramesh K. Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/) and [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/). Before enrolling at UMass, I was a research assistant and Master student at the [Communications and Multimedia Lab](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/new_cml_website/index.php),  National Taiwan University (NTU), where I was advised by Prof. [Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). 

I work at the intersection of computer vision and networking, with an emphasis on problems that hold implications for Domain Adaptation, Efficient DNNs, and Content Delivery Network (CDN). From a perspective of computer vision, I am interested in designing adaptive ML models, particularly of the problem scenarios where tasks are coming in a sequential and online manner. On the application side, I am especially interested in efforts which promote the use of DNNs for industry, such as neural adaptive content delivery and intelligent caching.
