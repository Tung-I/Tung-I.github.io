about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a Research Assistant at Communications and Multimedia Lab, National Taiwan University (NTU).
  I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE) in 2021 and my B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering (BME) in 2019.
  While working on my master's degree, I was involved in research in Computer Vision with a focus on Object Detection and Meta Learning. 
  Currently, I have profound interests in machine learning and optimization theory.
  I am primarily interested in developing reinforcement learning agents robust to environmental shifts.

          Developed a system where an object detector can generalize to novel domains without any human-annotated data by learning from visual observations collected by a grasping system.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Investigated the cause of low performance of few-shot object detectors and proposed a novelattention module that brings a 49% performance boost without the loss of computational efficiency.

          Project: Learning 6-DoF Task-Oriented Grasping for Manipulation Tasks
           - Built a novel end-to-end 6-DoF grasp detector that is twenty times faster and more accurate than previous end-to-end learning-based approaches on unseen cluttered objects.
           - Demonstrated online few-shot learning that a robotic arm firstly picks up an unseen objectin front of a camera and an object detector can be improved according to newly captured images.
           - Proposed a referring algorithm that can reason human’s instructions and enable robotic arms to understand the concept of relative object positions.
